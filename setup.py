# A simple setup script to create an executable running wxPython. This also
# demonstrates the method for creating a Windows executable that does not have
# an associated console.
#
# wxapp.py is a very simple 'Hello, world' type wxPython application
#
# Run the build process by running the command 'python setup.py build'
#
# If everything works well you should find a subdirectory in the build
# subdirectory that contains the files needed to run the application
